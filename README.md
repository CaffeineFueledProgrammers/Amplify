**Amplify** is a note-taking application inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [AnyType](https://anytype.io/) designed specifically for students. It integrates seamlessly with existing Google [Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)/[Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/) features while offering an AI-powered enhancement layer powered by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

- **Enhanced Note-Taking**: The students will take notes as they normally would, using text, images, or even voice recordings.
- **AI Processing**: The system will use artificial intelligence to process the notes. This could involve:
  - _Summarization_: Generating a summary of keypoints.
    - _Structure detection_: Automatically organizing notes based on identified headings and subheadings.
    - _Definition of Terms_: Identifying important terms and providing short definitions.
    - _Information retrieval/Further Reading_: Finding relevant web content related to the notes.
- **Intelligent Flashcard Generation:** Amplify analyzes notes and identifies key concepts. After that, it will automatically generate [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a popular spaced repetition system for effective memorization.
- **Sharing and Collaboration:** Users can share notes with classmates for group projects or study sessions. Collaborative features might include real-time editing and annotation.
